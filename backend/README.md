# Kanban

## Who?  
Developed by [Adam Sochorec](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamsochorec) during studies at [EASV](https://www.easv.dk), as a project utilizing REST API classes and progressive web applications.

## Why?  
This project was created to demonstrate REST API functionality, where a user interface dynamically interacts with a database by creating and managing data templates via API calls. The assignment was to build a simple Kanban app, similar to Trello, for task insertion and organization.

## When?  
Developed in 2024 as a school project.

## What?  
A Kanban board application that allows users to create, organize, and manage tasks dynamically. The goal was to implement a REST API with a structured frontend while following best practices for modern web development.

## How?  
- **Backend:** Built with Node.js using Express.js and MongoDB. Testing is implemented with Mocha.js.  
- **Frontend:** Developed in Vue.js, built with Vite, and styled using the [PrimeVue](https://www.primevue.org) component library.
